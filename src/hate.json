The new legislation could lead to imprisonment solely for a person's actual or imputed sexual orientation. People could face charges for consensual sexual relations in private; advocacy of LGBT rights; or public expression of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The terms \"same-sex marriage\" and \"civil union\" are so broadly defined in the law that they include virtually any form of same-sex cohabitation. Same-sex relations between men and between women are also punishable by state Sharia laws in various states in northern Nigeria.
